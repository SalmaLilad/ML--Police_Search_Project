###  Project Overview
This project investigates potential bias in police search decisions using open-source stop data. Through **data visualization** and **machine learning models**, it predicts whether a *person was searched* based on demographics, violation type, and stop reason.

Built as part of the University of Minnesota 2025 Basic Machine Learning Summer Camp **Capstone Project**, it explores fairness and real-world applications of AI in social data.

###  Dataset
- **Source:** [MLCamp2025 Police Stop Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sziccardi/MLCamp2025_DataRepository/main/Police_stop_data1.csv)
- **Size:** ~20,000 records, 15+ categorical variables
- **Key Variables:**
  - `preRace` ‚Äì perceived race
  - `reason` ‚Äì reason for stop
  - `problem` ‚Äì violation type
  - `vehicleSearch`, `personSearch` ‚Äì binary outcomes
  - `gender`, `callDisposition`, `citationIssued`, `precinct`

---

###  Methodology

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed missing values, encoded categorical variables using **`pd.get_dummies()`**  
- Normalized features and dropped incomplete rows  
- Performed visual EDA with `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib`

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- Predictor columns: `reason`, `vehicleSearch`, `precinct`, etc.  
- Target variable: `personSearch_YES` (binary classification)

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Comparison
| Model | Description | Accuracy |
|:------|:-------------|:----------:|
| **KNN** | Baseline classification | ~65% |
| **Decision Tree** | Interpretable model (visualized via Graphviz) | ~70% |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble model with improved stability | ~73% |
| **SVM (Linear, RBF, Poly, Sigmoid)** | Tested multiple kernels | 68‚Äì75% |
| **Logistic Regression** | Probabilistic baseline | ~72% |

###  Key Visuals
- Distribution of searches by race and problem type  
- Correlation matrix for predictive features  
- Confusion matrices for all classifiers  
- Scatter plots for logistic regression predictions

###  Insights
- *Vehicle searches* and *stop reasons* emerged as the strongest predictors of whether a person was searched.  
- Certain precincts and violation types displayed disproportionately higher search rates, indicating potential systemic bias.  
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models both confirmed consistent patterns aligning with known real-world enforcement disparities.  
- Visualizing the confusion matrices and feature importances helped connect quantitative model results with social impact interpretation.

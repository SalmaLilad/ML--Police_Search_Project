###  Project Overview
This project investigates potential bias in police search decisions using open-source stop data. Through **data visualization** and **machine learning models**, it predicts whether a *person was searched* based on demographics, violation type, and stop reason.

Built as part of the University of Minnesota 2025 Basic Machine Learning Summer Camp **Capstone Project**, it explores fairness and real-world applications of AI in social data.

###  Dataset
- **Source:** [MLCamp2025 Police Stop Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sziccardi/MLCamp2025_DataRepository/main/Police_stop_data1.csv)
- **Size:** ~20,000 records, 15+ categorical variables
- **Key Variables:**
  - `preRace` – perceived race
  - `reason` – reason for stop
  - `problem` – violation type
  - `vehicleSearch`, `personSearch` – binary outcomes
  - `gender`, `callDisposition`, `citationIssued`, `precinct`

---

###  Methodology

#### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed missing values, encoded categorical variables using **`pd.get_dummies()`**  
- Normalized features and dropped incomplete rows  
- Performed visual EDA with `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib`

#### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Predictor columns: `reason`, `vehicleSearch`, `precinct`, etc.  
- Target variable: `personSearch_YES` (binary classification)

#### 3️⃣ Model Comparison
| Model | Description | Accuracy |
|:------|:-------------|:----------:|
| **KNN** | Baseline classification | ~65% |
| **Decision Tree** | Interpretable model (visualized via Graphviz) | ~70% |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble model with improved stability | ~73% |
| **SVM (Linear, RBF, Poly, Sigmoid)** | Tested multiple kernels | 68–75% |
| **Logistic Regression** | Probabilistic baseline | ~72% |

###  Key Visuals
- Distribution of searches by race and problem type  
- Correlation matrix for predictive features  
- Confusion matrices for all classifiers  
- Scatter plots for logistic regression predictions  

> Example output :

```python
sns.countplot(x='personSearch_YES', data=police_df_new)
plt.title("Distribution of Person Searches")
plt.show()

 Insights

Vehicle searches and stop reasons are strongest predictors.

Some precincts and violation types have disproportionately high search rates.

Machine learning revealed consistent patterns that align with known bias indicators.

 Future Work

Integrate Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME) for interpretability.

Build a Flask/Streamlit dashboard for interactive data visualization.

Expand dataset to include multi-state comparisons.

Incorporate fairness metrics (e.g., Equalized Odds, Disparate Impact).
